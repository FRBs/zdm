This directory is for scripts to demonstrate core zDM capabilities

It is organised as follows:

Plotting_zDM:
Scripts for producing plots of probability distributions in z,DM space

MonteCarloFRBs
Scripts associated with zDM's ability to generate MC FRB samples

PlotIndividualExperiments
Scripts to produce zDM plots of the latest key experiments, such as ASKAP, CHIME, DSA, MeerTRAP etc

Demonstrations
Scripts to illustrate certain effects.

MCMC
Scripts related to, or requiring, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo run
