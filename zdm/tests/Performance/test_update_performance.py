"""
This file is intended to test the computing performance
when updating grids for a cube evaluation.

It tackles the following questions:
- How long does it take to update a grid for parameter X?
  (how much longer for additional grids beyond the first?)
- What is the optimal parameter order for cubing?
  (is this changed by the number of grids used in the cube?)
- Is the grid update method accurate?
  (and is it still accurate when using the many-cube shortcut?)
