This folder contains files used to generate simulate telescope beamshapes,
and convert them into Beamdata. These programs are independent of the zdm code,
but provide useful into to it.

The relevant programs are:

###### sim_fast_mutibeam.py ########
This program simulates the FAST multibeam system using data
contained in "FAST.dat", which is taken from
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/20/5/64/pdf
With little adaptation, it could also simulate Parkes and Arecibo
multibeam systems.

###### sim_askap_beams.py ########
This program is used to simulate the envelope formed by
ASKAP beams.


###### sim_DSA_beams.py ######
Used to simulate the beamhape from tied beams generated by
an array of coherently added antennas. It is used to simulate
e.g. DSA beamshapes - although the exact locations of DSA
antennas are not known. It could easily be adapted to an arbitrary
tied array (e.g. MeerKAT)
